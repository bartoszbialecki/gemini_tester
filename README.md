# Gemini Tester

This is a project using Robot Framework to test Gemini pharmacy webpage.

To run tests, we have to install first all dependencies from the file `requirements.txt`. Then we can just run `run.sh` script from the terminal.

Set GEMINI_TESTER_USERNAME and GEMINI_TESTER_PASSWORD environment variables to test login functionality with correct credentials.
